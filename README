Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  libc
  libdbus
  eina (at least 1.1.0)
  ecore (at least 1.1.0)

Recommended:
  evas (at least 1.1.0)

This is the start of some basic convenience wrappers around dbus to ease
integrating dbus with EFL based applications.

When using e_dbus, direct use of the low level dbus api is still heavily
required for processing messages.

A few things to note:

e_dbus_bus_get() currently creates a new private connection to whichever bus
is passed in, and hooks this into the ecore main loop. At some point, we
should implement internal refcounting and sharing of these private
connections (one for each bus type) so that e.g. multiple modules in an app
can reuse the same connection. libdbus implements its own shared connections
(available via dbus_bus_get()), but the final reference is always retained by
libdbus iteself, causing any cleanup handlers on the connection to only be
called at app exit. Thus, if a module hooks a connection in to the mainloop,
there is no way to clean up fully before unloading the module, causing issues.

Patches can be sent to the enlightenment dev mailing list, or, if you have
commit access, feel free to commit.
